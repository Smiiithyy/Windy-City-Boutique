# WindyCityBoutique

Project used CRUD, Express, Mongoose, EJS, Bootstrap

Overall, setting up the CRUD of the project was not too difficult. Figuring out how to style and align the items was more of the difficulty since we have not done HTML or CSS for quite some time. I originally had some issues getting the online database to connect and had to troubleshoot on the actual site instead of through my code. 

As a user I am able to log in and log out
As a user I am able to both add and remove items from the websie
As a user I can edit items on the website
As a user I can easily navigate between pages

I would like to add more interactive features to the website and also ultimately allow different features to different users
I would also like to add a shopping/cart functionality
